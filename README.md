Vigipool is an innovative app to control and manage your swimming pool remotely.

This installer will configure Home Assistant to add the main features of the Vigipool application to your interface.

List of Vigipool devices compatible with the installer:
- Tild
- Phileo VP
- Ofix
- AnteaM + Meteor
- Zelia
- VigiBrio

## Prerequisites

### Vigipool product

- Have a Vigipool product
- Use the Vigipool mobile application to connect to the Vigipool product then configure the product to connect it to your Wi-Fi and know its IP
- You must first have already configured the Home Assistant MQTT before launching the installer. To do this, see this link: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/

### In case of multiple MQTT Server

If you have multiple MQTT servers you must use one of these two methods

#### Method 1 : Using and configuring the Mosquitto broker Addon
Please note that to use this method, you will probably have to completely restart the Vigipool products.
- Go to "Settings"
- Go to "Add-ons"
- Install or go to "Mosquitto broker"
- go to "Configuration"
- In the "Customize" menu replace "active: false" with "active: true"

- In your file explorer go into homeassistant > share > mosquitto
- create a file nammed "mosquitto.conf"

- add the following content in the file : 
```
connection bridge-01
address 192.168.1.XX:1883 # Ip address of your vigipool device
topic # both 0
cleansession true
start_type automatic
try_private false
restart_timeout 10
bridge_protocol_version mqttv31
bridge_attempt_unsubscribe false
#log_type all
```
! **Note:**
Having the following :
_topic # both 0_ will sync *ALL* messages between the Vigipool broker and the HA broker. (this means Vigipool will receive all messages from HA as well) which is **NOT** recommended, especially on large MQTT infra.
Instead it is preferable to filter the messages (inbound and outbound) like this:
topic tild_XXX/u16_r/value_temp/# out 0  # Only the messages on this topic will flow from the TILD to the HA Broker (useful to get the temp info as it's only 1 way)
topic anteavs_XXX/# both 0 # All subtopics will flow both ways (inbound and outbound) from AnteaVS to HA Broker.  This is useful for example on data that needs to be sync'd both ways : like get the Pump speed from Antea + Set the pump speed from HA.
REMIND to customize the topics based on your configuration (you can always use MQTT Explorer). In my setup AnteaVS is the MQTT Vigipool proxy or "Centrale Vigipool"; For some reason it's more stable
